# Overview of project

## Twitter Streaming

### 1. Twitter API
Twitter will be used to gather data to be visualized in the development of the application.  Twitter has given developers the opportunity to access Tweet data through the use of their APIs. An application-programming interface (API) is a set of instructions and standards that decides how one application communicates with another. Facebook and Twitter are possibly the most popular APIs for social media content. In Twitter’s case, developers have access to two main types of APIs, their REST APIs and their Streaming APIs. This application will make use of their Streaming APIs in order to gain access to Twitter’s global stream of Tweet data.

2. Tweepy
Using the Python library Tweepy, it is possible to gain access to the Twitter API through the execution of a Python script. The data is then streamed in JSON format. The Tweet data has numerous pieces of information about each tweet. The structure of one Tweet is shown in Appendix A.

In order to access the Twitter API, user tokens and customer keys must be obtained from the Twitter Developers website by creating a developer account.

3. Elasticsearch
ElasticSearch will be used to store the tweets.

4. streaming framework (spark...)


## Understand the tweets/ hashtags, words

1. Get list of users, search queries from Marc
2. Figure out how to analyse tweets to detect bots, etc

## Visualisation 

1. What are we visualising

The main aim of the visualisation aspect of the project is to allow users to view tweets generated by bots. Other aspects of the visualisation will be to outline the spikes in bot activity over a 24 hour period as well as to show connections between bots. There will also be a visualisation to allow users to determine what topics/tags are being talked about.

2. User Interface Design

The user interface of the application will be an interactive dashboard with a range of charts and graphs. There will be a counter displayed at the top of the page which will highlight the number of tweets generated by bots over the course of the project. This will be in real-time. The main focus of the dashboard will be tweets, generated by bots, appearing one after another. These will appear on screen in-focus and then fade out as the most recent tweet appears. The information of the bot i.e. username will also appear alongside the tweet. 

A line graph will be used to show the fluctuation in bot activity over a 24 hour period. Users will also be able to select which day they want to view information on. This graph will be updated every 24 hours. The fourth feature on the dashboard will be a network diagram showing the relationships and connections between bots based on their followers and friends as well as mentions. The links between users (nodes) will be weighted based on the number of times those users interacted with each other. This diagram will be offline. 

Finally, a streamgraph will be used to show the number of tweets per N topics. Users will be able to select whether they want to view a streamgraph for topics, tags or bots.
