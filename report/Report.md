# Overview of project

## Twitter Streaming

### 1. Twitter API
Twitter will be used to gather data to be visualized in the development of the application.  Twitter has given developers the opportunity to access Tweet data through the use of their APIs. An application-programming interface (API) is a set of instructions and standards that decides how one application communicates with another. Facebook and Twitter are possibly the most popular APIs for social media content. In Twitter’s case, developers have access to two main types of APIs, their REST APIs and their Streaming APIs. This application will make use of their Streaming APIs in order to gain access to Twitter’s global stream of Tweet data.

2. Tweepy
Using the Python library Tweepy, it is possible to gain access to the Twitter API through the execution of a Python script. The data is then streamed in JSON format. The Tweet data has numerous pieces of information about each tweet. The structure of one Tweet is shown in Appendix A.

In order to access the Twitter API, user tokens and customer keys must be obtained from the Twitter Developers website by creating a developer account.

3. Elasticsearch
ElasticSearch will be used to store the tweets.
